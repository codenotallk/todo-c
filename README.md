# Explanation

In this video, we will implement the prompt. This will be the last part of our project.
After that, we can do some improvements, but the project itself will be ready to be used.

The read command must return always a lower case string

To command process, I will create a struct to join the command and the handler, but internal.
The same that I did in action manager

To process a command. We use the struct just created. We scan looking for the entered command.

On exit we need to ask: If the user wants to really quit. If the user did some modifications

In remove/update/complete functions. We need to ask the ID.

Next video I will call the prompt to execute and see how many errors will pop up. :)
